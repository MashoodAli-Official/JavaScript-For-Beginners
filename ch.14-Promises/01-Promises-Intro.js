// In web programming the Asynchronous programming is a challenging topic. 
// The asynchronous operation is allow to computer not to hault the other task meanwhile when asynchronous operation is in process.
// REAL TIME EXAMPLE 
// There are countless examples of asynchronicity in our everyday lives. Cleaning our house,
//  for example, involves asynchronous operations such as a dishwasher washing our dishes or 
//  a washing machine washing our clothes. While we wait on the completion of those operations,
//   weâ€™re free to do other chores.
