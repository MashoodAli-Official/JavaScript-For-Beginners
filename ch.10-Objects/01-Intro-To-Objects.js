// Introduction to Objects, In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type.
// Like Every object in Real life is having some properties and characteristics, similarly in programming objects are having properties and methods.
// Like a Dog is having properties like color, breed, age, etc. and methods like bark, eat, sleep, etc.
// A car is having properties like color, model, price, etc. and methods like start, stop, move, etc.
// Same like real life programming the Objects in Javascript having some properties and methods.
