// In some case we need a statement that run small block of code at least one time and then check the condition using while statement. 
// In this case, we can use do-while statement.

// Example of do-while loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5
let i = 1;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);
