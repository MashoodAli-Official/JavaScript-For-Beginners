//The built-in methods are the methods that are already defined in the JavaScript language. These methods are used to perform some operations on the datatypes. Some of the built-in methods are:
console.log(Math.random()); // It will returns a random number between 0 and 1
console.log(Number.isInteger(5)); // It will returns true if the number is an integer otherwise false.
console.log(Number.isInteger('Hello')); // It will returns false because 'Hello' is not a number.
